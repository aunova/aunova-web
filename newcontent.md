 The Problem
AI needs your data. Your data needs protection.

üõ†Ô∏è Our Solution
We build secure, privacy-first AI systems using cutting-edge cryptography:

Zero-Knowledge Proofs for verifiable results

Fully Homomorphic Encryption to run AI on encrypted data

Blockchain to log decisions immutably for full auditability

WHAT WE DO (renombrar a ‚ÄúSolutions‚Äù o ‚ÄúUse Cases‚Äù)
We build applied privacy solutions combining AI, blockchain and cryptography.

 Use Case 1: AI on medical records
Challenge: Hospitals want to run predictive AI on patient data without exposing personal info.

Our solution: Homomorphic AI models + ZK verification + blockchain audit trail.

 Use Case 2: Financial fraud detection
Challenge: Banks need to detect fraud patterns using sensitive customer data.

Our solution: Encrypted AI + privacy-preserving patterns on blockchain.

Use Case 3: Automated decision-making with compliance
Challenge: Companies must show how automated decisions are made, without exposing data.

Our solution: AI explainability + immutable logs + ZK transparency.
